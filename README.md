Android Engineer Technical Assessment

### Choice of architecture
For architecture, I chose to go simple, monolith app with MVVM

### About the app
The project was written in kotlin, MVVM, Coroutines, Flow and Hilt for DI in a limited number of hours

### Offline cahching & Paging?
No offline caching or Paging was implemented in this app bacause the app mostly needs fresh data and there was a limited amount of time
